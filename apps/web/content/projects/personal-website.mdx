A personal portfolio and blog built from scratch using modern web technologies.

## Stack

- **Next.js** for static site generation and routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible, composable UI components
- **Turborepo** for monorepo management

## Highlights

The site is fully statically exported and deployed to GitHub Pages, with zero server-side logic at runtime. Content is managed via MDX files using Content Collections for type-safe frontmatter validation.
